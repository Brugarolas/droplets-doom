# Droplets: Simulated Blood

Droplets is not a mod intended to simply make your game gorier or to add flashy effects. It's a procedural blood mod that tries to mimic sprays and blood splatters using very basic particles, and it can be adjusted anywhere from Mild drips and squirts to Excessive, gushing sprays. Blood drips from ceilings and makes liquid surfaces, like water, foggy. This is the blood mod for the Doom player that appreciates attention to detail and added visual complexity.

## About this repository

Droplets is not my creation. It is a mod by SidDoyle of the ZDoom Forums (original thread [here](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=46509)). Unfortunately SidDoyle has been MIA since 2017-03-25 and many of his projects have fallen to link rot. Since Droplets is rather popular, this repository is intended to archive the last known versions of his code and enable subsequent patches or improvements from the community at large. 

## About branches

Droplets was released in various versions with multiple variants, intended to provide options for compatibility with other popular mods. Using branches seems to be the most logical solution to replicate what SidDoyle intended. As such, the master branch will likely not contain any code. Rather, you must select which branch you wish to use.

* [v14 Standard Edition](https://github.com/caligari87/droplets/tree/v14) ([.zip](https://github.com/caligari87/droplets/archive/v14.zip))
* [v15 Standard Edition](https://github.com/caligari87/droplets/tree/v15) ([.zip](https://github.com/caligari87/droplets/archive/v15.zip))

Other branches and compatability patches will be added, and described here as requested.
